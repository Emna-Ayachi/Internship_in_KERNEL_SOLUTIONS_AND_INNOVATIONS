🎓 Student Mentorship Web App – MERN Stack Project This is my first MERN Stack project, built during my internship. The idea was to create a web application that acts as a “source financière” for university students by allowing them to connect with peer mentors. 💡 Project Concept The app allows students to: Log in / sign up Browse and book mentors (other students who offer help in academic or financial areas) Schedule appointments based on mentor availability Receive notifications when their appointment is accepted Get redirected to chat with the mentor if their request is declined (chat feature is still in progress) Workflow: -A mentor sets their availability on their calendar. -A student can book an appointment within those available slots. -The mentor receives a request and can accept or decline. -If accepted, the appointment is added to both calendars and the student is notified. -If declined, the mentor is redirected to a chat with the student (feature under development) to propose an alternative time. 🛠️ Tech Stack -MongoDB -Express.js -React -Node.js 🚧 Current Status The project is still in development. While it's not complete yet, working on it taught me a lot — especially the importance of: Planning folder structure and organizing code properly Building user flows and integrating calendar-based logic Working with full-stack tools and managing backend-frontend communication 🔍 Notes This was my first MERN stack project. The folder structure is still a bit messy — something I’ll definitely improve in future projects.
